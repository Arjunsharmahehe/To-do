# To 'do' list - using local storage

It's a simple [to-do list](https://arjunsharmahehe.github.io/To-do/) website that let's you add tasks in the list, **complete them**, **edit them**, and **see the completed task**.

## Color Reference
I didn't use variables for the colors, feel free to add them. I will surely push them to the main branch.

| Color             | Hex                                                                |
